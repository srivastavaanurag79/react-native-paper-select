# Installation

This library depends on [react-native-paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/getting-started.html) and [react-native-vector-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-vector-icons). If you use [React Native Paper](https://reactnativepaper.com/) you probably already have it in your dependencies, so you're good to go. If not, please follow the instructions [here](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/getting-started.html) to install it. Then run:

```bash
yarn add react-native-paper-select
```

or

```bash
npm install react-native-paper-select
```
